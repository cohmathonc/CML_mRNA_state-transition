# State-transition model and survival analysis

## Overview
These MATLAB files were used to perform all state-transition modeling and survival analysis. For analysis of the RNA-seq data see the [R notebook](https://github.com/cohmathonc/CML_mRNA_state-transition/R/analysis+figure_reproducibility.R).

## :::WORK IN PROGRESS::

Coming soon: further documentation and annotation to describe the workflow to reproduce the analysis conducted in [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.11.561908v2)
